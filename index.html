<h3>About Me
</h3>

    <p id="Intro">
      Hi! My name is Michelle. Welcome to my website! I am currently a high school student with a growing passion for all things tech. As I began my high school career, I started to learn more about Information Technology and have dreams of becoming a Cybersecurity Engineer. 
<br>
<br>
    In this website you will learn about my interests, the knowledge I have in tech so far, and what I hope to learn in the future. I will also give you a glimpse in my life-long interest in the arts, more specifically in music and poetry. Have fun exploring! 
     </p>
