# Welcome to my personal website project!

## Overview
Hi everyone! This is a personal website I created with the help of Girls Who Code to share more about who I am, the things I'm interested in, and the projects I have worked 
on so far in both STEM and the arts! At the time of creating this, I am a rising sophomore learning about Information Technology at my technical high school. I have dreams of pursuing 
cybersecurity and computer science in college and attending the Air Force!

## Home
The "Home" page is a brief overview of my interests.

## STEM Portfolio
The "STEM Portfolio" page shows off what I have worked on in STEM. In the page, I speak about the programs and certificates I've received so far. I also show a math game I created with a 
partner in scratch and a presentation I made about biometrics.

## Arts
The "Arts" page gives an overview of three poems that I wrote and brief descriptions. If you click on the image or title of the poem, it will bring you to a poem page where there is an
audio recording of the poem and the poem in writing. At the bottom of the "Arts" main page, I also showed off a podcasts I created with one of my friends in English using storytelling
to talk about the dark truths behind nursery rhymes!

## Thank you for visiting, and I hope you like the website.
