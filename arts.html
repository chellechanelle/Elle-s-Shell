        For as long as I can remember, I have loved daydreaming and coming up with stories in my head. When I entered middle school, I began writing poetry to process my emotions better and create stories. This year I was blessed to get into Poetry Out Loud, allowing me to perform poetry works. In the future, I hope to publish the book that Iâ€™m currently working on! Here are some of my favorite poems that I've written!

      <img src="assets/whenapoet.jpg" alt= "Photo of trees in the woods with orange leaves during fall tilting towards a pond reflecting the trees."class="tree"/>
    </a>

     <p>This is a poem about the deep and intricate feelings artists go through when they "fall in love" and their need to express these emotions in their work. </p>

  This year as my English final my friend and I used our creativity to create a one-episode podcast on Spotify, incorporating principles of storytelling and music. We chose to talk about the dark truths behind nursery rhymes. Go ahead and listen!
